# Ergodic Pong Review

Having learned from [Espen Aarseth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espen_Aarseth) what [ergodic literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature) is, I decided to create a piece, too.
This game is esentially a text about the videogame Pong, and you have to play Pong while reading it, so the longer you stay in the game the more you learn.

So far, there is only a Russian version available.
