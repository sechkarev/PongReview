# Ergodic Pong Review

Having learned from [Espen Aarseth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espen_Aarseth) what [ergodic literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature) is, I decided to create a piece, too.
This game is esentially a text about the videogame Pong, and you have to play Pong while reading it, so the longer you stay in the game the more you learn.

Give it a try [on Itch.io](https://ultra-v1olence.itch.io/ergodic-pong-review). So far, there is only a Russian version available.
